# SDG : life on earth
# Ideas :
1. have the palyer run to catch all stuff living
2. And then they get awarded with points depending on the rating of the species they capture
3. differnt species are given labels as safe, endangered, extint etc.. and the same will be displayed as a cool effect on each of them
4. there can be mistery boxes kinda stuff which they can open after the game is over (could be a reward, or a fact)
5. they can anytime see the collection of their species
# Dev Tools :
Unity 2d, that is all

# Learning Sources :
Brackeys!!!
